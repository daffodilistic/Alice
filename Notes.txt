Michael Vorburger's notes
to understand how to add a new Event type to Alice.org
for adding Wii remote support to Alice.org
---

BehaviorGroupEditor is used in the BehaviorGroupsEditor

AuthoringToolResources.resources.behaviorClasses

package edu.cmu.cs.stage3.alice.core.behavior has KeyClickBehavior & Co.

Behaviours are defined in those horribly *.py configurations:
* Alice Style.py
* StandardResources.py
* Java Style.py 

Search for one of the existing behaviours, and copy/paste everything...

Start creating an Event (Behavior) without properties... simpler.
